# Code for Design Patterns in C\# 
From *[Design Patterns in C\#](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321126971/xp123com)*, by Steve Metsker, ISBN 0321126971. 

The file ``oozinoz_cs_1.04.zip`` contains the original code from the book. 

See ``license.txt`` for the license.

The latest code has been updated to a more modern version of C# - but left comparable to what's in the book. (More improvements could be done, but would make it even less compatible.)

(Unfortunately, the WebService example did not survive modernization, but the code's still available to look at.)

Unfortunately, Steve died in 2008, so Bill Wake ([william.wake@acm.org](mailto: william.wake@acm.org)) is maintaining this repository.
