# Page 24 - Revealing the namespace for the Program class

In the **Good Practice** box, I wrote, "Code editors have a feature named code snippets. These allow you to insert pieces of code that you commonly use, by typing a shortcut and pressing *Tab* twice." But you only need to press *Tab* once.

I wrote, "In the preceding steps, I showed you how to use the dotnet CLI to create solutions and projects. Finally, with the August 2024 or later releases of the C# Dev Kit, VS Code has an improved project creation experience that provides you access to the same options you can use when creating a new project through the `dotnet` CLI. To enable this ability, you must change a setting, as shown in the following configuration:"
```
"csharp.experimental.dotnetNewIntegration": true
```

This feature is no longer in preview so you do not need to enable it. In the next edition, I will remove the sentence about enabling it and the setting.

In the two command lines, I used `/p` to set a project property when I should have used `-p`. The complete command is:
```
dotnet publish -r win10-x64 -c Release --no-self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

In *Table 8.6*, the entry for `{,3}` is wrong. That is not a valid range and so it actually matches the exact string `{,3}`! To match "Up to three", you should use `{0,3}` or `{1,3}` depending on whether you want to accept zero or one as the lowest value. I will fix this in the 10th edition.

# Page 650 - Testing the class libraries, Page 693 - Build a data-driven web page, Page 694 - Build web pages for functions

I end the **Testing the class libraries** section by writing, "Finally, in this chapter, let’s review some key concepts about web development, enabling us to be better prepared to dive into ASP.NET Core Razor Pages in the next chapter."

In the **Build a data-driven web page** exercise, I wrote, "Add a Razor Page to the `Northwind.Web` website..."

In the **Build web pages for functions** exercise, I wrote, "Reimplement some of the console apps from earlier chapters as Razor Pages;"

In these instances, "Razor Pages" or "Razor Page" should be "Blazor" or "Blazor page component".

In Step 3, I wrote, "In `Program.cs`, before the call to `Build`, in the section for configuring services, register the hybrid cache service..."

Unfortunately, even after the release of .NET 9 on November 12, 2024, the `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Hybrid` package is still in preview, and the `AddHybridCache` method call causes a compiler warning. Until the package is released as GA, you will need to surround the call with a temporary warning suppression, as shown in the following code:
```cs
#pragma warning disable EXTEXP0018 // Type is for evaluation purposes only and is subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.
builder.Services.AddHybridCache(options =>
{
  options.DefaultEntryOptions = new HybridCacheEntryOptions
  {
    Expiration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(60),
    LocalCacheExpiration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30)
  };
});
#pragma warning restore EXTEXP0018 // Type is for evaluation purposes only and is subject to change or removal in future updates. Suppress this diagnostic to proceed.
```

# Exercise 13.2 – practice exercises - Build web pages for functions

This exercise should have been in *Chapter 14 Building Interactive Web Components Using Blazor*, because it is much easier to implement using interactive Blazor features rather than the limited Blazor static server-side rendering (SSR).

Updated functions page to use server-side interactivity:
https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/code/ModernWeb/Northwind.Blazor/Northwind.Blazor/Components/Pages/Functions.razor

Updated navmenu to include link to functions page:
https://github.com/markjprice/cs13net9/blob/main/code/ModernWeb/Northwind.Blazor/Northwind.Blazor/Components/Layout/NavMenu.razor
